    courseTitle: 'Mathematics',
    content: 'Mathematics is the language of numbers and shapes, used to describe, analyze, and understand the world around us. /n It consists of several fundamental concepts that form the building blocks for more advanced mathematical topics. In this overview, we\'ll explore some of these basic concepts. 1. Numbers and Operations Natural Numbers: Natural numbers are the counting numbers, starting from 1 and extending infinitely (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) Whole Numbers: Whole numbers include all the natural numbers along with zero (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). Integers: Integers include all whole numbers and their negative counterparts, along with zero (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...). Rational Numbers: Rational numbers are those that can be expressed as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. For example, 1/2, -3/4, and 5 are all rational numbers. Irrational Numbers: Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as fractions and have non-repeating, non-terminating decimal expansions. Examples include √2 and π. Real Numbers: Real numbers include both rational and irrational numbers, covering the entire number line. Operations: The basic operations in mathematics include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations follow specific rules and properties.  2. Basic Algebra',
